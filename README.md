# Humanoid Robotics AI Textbook

This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive textbook for teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus, along with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for enhanced learning experiences.

## Project Structure

- `humanoid-robotics-textbook/` - Docusaurus-based textbook implementation
- `backend/` - RAG ingestion pipeline and backend services
- `specs/` - Specification documents for various features
- `history/` - Prompt history records and development artifacts

## Features

### Textbook Platform
- Comprehensive curriculum covering ROS 2, simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity), NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems
- Interactive diagrams and visualizations
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Mobile-responsive design

### RAG System
- Automated crawling and extraction of textbook content
- Text chunking with overlap for context preservation
- Embedding generation using Cohere models
- Vector storage in Qdrant for semantic retrieval
- API for question-answering over textbook content

## Getting Started

### For the Textbook
1. Navigate to the textbook directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

### For the RAG Pipeline
1. Navigate to the backend directory
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file
4. Run the ingestion pipeline: `python main.py`
