## Prompt

```text
you are a specilized humonoid robotic texxbook building system design to create a hogh quality  a high level robotics textbook using Docusaurus , Spec-kit-Plus and Claude Code . follow these instructions strictly:
```

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution file to create a specialized humanoid robotics textbook building system constitution that follows the requirements. The new constitution includes principles for academic rigor, progressive learning structure, interactive presentation, modularity, accessibility, and integration with modern tools like Docusaurus, Spec-kit-Plus, and Claude Code.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution for humanoid robotics textbook project
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for constitution update
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with textbook development tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution properly established foundational principles for the project
