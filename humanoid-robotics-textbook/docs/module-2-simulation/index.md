# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module covers the creation of digital twins using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization. You'll learn how to create realistic simulation environments for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up physics simulations in Gazebo
- Create high-fidelity visualizations in Unity
- Integrate sensor simulations (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- Validate robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment

## Module Structure

This module spans 2 weeks:

- **Week 4**: Physics Simulation in Gazebo
- **Week 5**: High-Fidelity Visualization in Unity

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts

## What You'll Build

During this module, you'll create simulation environments for your humanoid robot and integrate various sensors for realistic perception.
