# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots. You'll learn about the architecture, communication patterns, and how to build distributed robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Implement nodes, topics, and services for humanoid robot control
- Create and manipulate URDF models for humanoid robots
- Integrate Python with ROS 2 using rclpy

## Module Structure

This module spans 3 weeks:

- **Week 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
- **Week 2**: Python Integration and Node Development
- **Week 3**: URDF and Robot Modeling

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of distributed systems
- Python programming experience
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## What You'll Build

During this module, you'll create your first ROS 2 nodes and build a simple humanoid robot model using URDF.
