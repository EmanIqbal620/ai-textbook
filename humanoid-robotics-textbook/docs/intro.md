# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This textbook is designed to provide a complete learning experience for students interested in humanoid robotics, covering everything from fundamental ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured into 4 main modules spanning 13 weeks:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - 3 weeks
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - 2 weeks
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - 3 weeks
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - 5 weeks

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this textbook, students will be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2-based humanoid robot systems
- Create digital twins using Gazebo and Unity simulations
