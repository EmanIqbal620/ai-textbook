# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module covers the integration of vision, language, and action systems to create autonomous humanoid robots capable of understanding and responding to human commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Integrate voice recognition with OpenAI Whisper
- Implement LLM-based cognitive planning
- Create end-to-end Vision-Language-Action systems
- Complete a capstone project with autonomous humanoid

## Module Structure

This module spans 5 weeks:

- **Week 9**: Voice Recognition and Processing
- **Week 10**: LLM Cognitive Planning
- **Week 11**: Vision Integration
- **Week 12**: Action Execution and Control
- **Week 13**: Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Familiarity with computer vision and robotics

## What You'll Build

During this module, you'll create a complete autonomous humanoid system that can understand voice commands, plan actions using LLMs, and execute complex tasks.
