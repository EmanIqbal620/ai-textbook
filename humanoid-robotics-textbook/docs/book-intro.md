# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Comprehensive Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This textbook is designed to provide a complete learning experience for students interested in humanoid robotics, covering everything from fundamental ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems.

## About This Book

This textbook represents the convergence of three revolutionary technologies:

- **Physical AI**: The integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems
- **Humanoid Robotics**: The development of human-like robots with advanced capabilities
- **Embodied Cognition**: The understanding that intelligence emerges from the interaction between brain, body, and environment

### Book Structure

This textbook is organized into 4 main modules spanning 13 weeks:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - 3 weeks
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - 2 weeks
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - 3 weeks
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - 5 weeks

### Learning Approach

This textbook takes a hands-on, project-based approach to learning. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robotics systems. You'll progress from basic concepts to complex implementations, with practical exercises at every step.
