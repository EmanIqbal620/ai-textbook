# Assessment Methods and Guidelines

This section provides guidelines for assessing progress and understanding throughout the textbook.

## Assessment Structure

### Formative Assessments (Weekly)

These assessments are designed to provide ongoing feedback during the learning process:

- **Code Reviews**: Review and critique code examples and exercises
- **Debugging Exercises**: Identify and fix issues in provided code samples
- **Conceptual Quizzes**: Short quizzes to test understanding of key concepts
- **Peer Collaboration**: Group discussions and collaborative problem-solving

### Summative Assessments

These assessments evaluate overall understanding at key milestones:

- **Module Projects**: Demonstrate understanding of each module through practical implementation
- **Midterm Simulation**: Comprehensive evaluation using simulation environments
- **Final Capstone Project**: Complete autonomous humanoid implementation
- **Technical Documentation**: Clear documentation of implementations and processes

## Grading Criteria

### Technical Implementation (40%)
- Correctness and functionality of code implementations
- Proper use of ROS 2, simulation tools, and AI frameworks
- Integration between different components and modules

### Code Quality and Documentation (20%)
- Clean, well-structured, and readable code
- Proper documentation and comments
- Following best practices and coding standards

### Problem-Solving Approach (20%)
- Logical approach to solving robotics challenges
- Effective use of debugging and troubleshooting techniques
- Creative solutions to complex problems

### Project Presentation and Demonstration (20%)
- Clear presentation of implemented solutions
- Effective demonstration of functionality
- Ability to explain design decisions and trade-offs

## Learning Objectives Assessment

Each module includes specific learning objectives that are assessed through:

- Practical exercises that demonstrate the objective
- Code implementations that showcase understanding
- Written explanations that articulate concepts
- Integration tasks that connect multiple concepts

## Self-Assessment Tools

### Checklists
- Technical implementation checklists for each module
- Best practices verification lists
- Code quality assessment forms

### Milestone Reviews
- Weekly self-reflection on progress
- Understanding verification exercises
- Skill assessment questionnaires
